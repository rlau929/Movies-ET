## Assumptions
The ETL module was exciting since we learned to manipulate multiple sources of data and combining it to perform new data analysis. We can assume the data will have similar information but different labels/titles. We will have to manipulate the data so that we can group the labels/titles together since it has similar information, just different names. Second, we can assume the data will have different data types such as int, str, float, and etc. and we will have to convert the types if necessary. Third assumption, currency might have labels such as millions/billions. Since it is difficult to perform calculations on strings, we have to convert it to an int (or something else depending on the goal) and remove millions/billions so that we are left with whole numbers to perform calculations. Fourth assumption is that the date can be converted to dd/mm/yyyy or other timestamp format to make it cleaner. Fifth assumption is that the data will consists of missing information or NaN. So we will have to figure out a way to fill in the data or omit the data.
